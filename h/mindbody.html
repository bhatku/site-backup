				<a>What is Physical and Mental Stamina Building?</a>
				<div class="content">
					In the wild animals remain in pink of their physical and mental stamina all the time because even a
					slight decrease in one’s ability makes him/her an easier prey to its predators. Hence, wild
					environment is designed to keep everyone’s stamina fit; there is <strong>no room for
						lethargy</strong> there. <br> On the
					contrary, humans have lot of support system and even people with poorer physical or mental stamina
					can survive. However, there is no point in merely surviving, life is a onetime affair and it should
					be lived with fullest of its potential, pleasure, meaning and purpose and one’s physical and mental
					stamina play pivotal role in this. <br><br>

					It would be a good idea to first have a look at the larger picture of our being and needs. We are
					basically comprised of 3 things – <strong>body, mind and DNA</strong>. <strong>Body </strong>is most
					existential in nature as it is
					completely lost after the death. <strong>Basic needs</strong> of body are: nutrition, workout and
					sleep, and a proper
					balance in these things helps boost stamina. Unfortunately these days body needs are quite
					disturbed: most people are suffering from malnutrition (because of food scarcity or abundance of
					addictive junk food), lack of workout (humans long believed physical work being treacherous and
					disgusting), and modernity having have deprived the most humanity from quality sleep. And hence, we
					are severely poorer in our physical stamina compared to our hunter-gatherer ancestors.
					<br><br>
					<img src="../images/mindbody1.png" alt="" class="rounded wow fadeInRight float-md-right mb-2 mx-1"
						style="max-width: 100%;">

					Our <strong>mind</strong> is more experiential in nature and it nurtures with a proper balance of
					<strong>
						information,
						observation and imagination.
					</strong> These days there is extreme abundance of information (and
					entertainment) and it is eating away space of observation and imagination. There is an urgent need
					to cutting down to the information feed to our minds so that its observational and imaginative
					capacities are retained.

					<br><br>

					Our <strong>DNA</strong> is the 3rd component of our being and is generational in nature. The DNA is mostly
					interested in fertility because it is through fertilization and reproduction that genes get a chance
					to repair and also to move ahead to the next generation. This module is limited to building physical
					and mental stamina only. <br><br>
					Per se, physical and mental stamina are quite interconnected as well. Strenuous physical labor
					improves physical stamina through muscle building, while doing this also enhances a substance called
					‘Serotonin’.<strong> Serotonin</strong> is a neurotransmitter and has many function in the body, the first being the
					neurotransmission itself, meaning thereby enhanced levels of Serotonin would improve neural
					functions. Apart from this it is also known as ‘Feel Good’ hormone as it brings in motivation and
					sense of reward. <br> Serotonin is also a precursor to <strong>Melatonin, the sleep hormone;</strong> and hence, improved
					levels of serotonin help bring-in quality sleep, which enhances mental clarity and intuition.


					<br>
					<img src="../images/mindbody2.png" alt="" class="rounded wow fadeInLeft float-md-right mb-2 mx-1"
						style="max-width: 100%;">

					In this module<strong> physical stamina</strong> building means enhancing muscles, endurance, flexibility and
					immunity so that one can not only fulfill normal life pursuits, but also venture into some kind of
					adventures to enjoy broader exploration of the life.<br> <strong>Mental stamina</strong> building aims at getting rid of
					clutter and conditioning of the mind and bringing-in clarity, focus flow and continuity at one hand,
					and enhanced neural functionality at the other.

			<a>Therapeutic Protocol</a>
			<div class="content active">
				This protocol has 3 in-forest and 1 post-forest stages. It begins with acclimatization and epigenetic
				balancing and then moves to cleansing – both physical and mental, followed by the actual stamina
				building steps.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Acclimatization and Epigenetic Balancing (5 days):</strong> <br> Forest stay helps
						fine-tunes gene switching, and once gene-switching is fine-tuned most hormones acquire required
						balance. Since most people live so much in their mind that they lose their body-mind connect, to
						reestablish this it is proposed that during this phase all mental pursuits, indulgences and
						stimulations are kept to bare minimum and physical activities are increased in the ambiance of
						basic elements are wilderness.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Autophagic cleansing and rejuvenation (5-10 days):</strong> <br> Water only fasting for
						5 or more days dramatically cleanse body and mind both - by detoxing, de-cluttering and
						de-condition. At the same time Sehatvan’s safe community also helps in mental catharsis. Longer
						periods of fasting are rejuvenative in nature and lead to rebooting the immunity and formation
						of new stem cells and neurons. However, during this phase people carrying toxicities may feel
						varied uncomfortable detox symptoms, and hence, this step should be taken-up under a supportive
						and pristine environment.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Stamina building (5-15 days):</strong> <br>
						Once cleansing is over the 3rd step of the protocol i.e. stamina building is taken up. During
						this stage nutrient uptake is gradually increased (with particular emphasis on vitaminizing
						through green juices, and protein and caloric uptake). Physically activities are also gradually
						enhanced. The enhanced physical labor not only boosts physical stamina, brings neural boosting
						as well. To enhance the imagination creative writing, dance, music, painting, sculpting etc is
						recommended depending upon individual’s inclination.
					</li>

			<a>Supplementary Home Protocol</a>
			<div class="content">
				Subsequent to the forest component participants are given a tailor made home protocol, which primarily
				aims at living a non-sedentary, un-cluttered lifestyle with proper nutrition for 4 to 8 weeks.



			</div>
			<a>Daily/ Hourly Protocols </a>
			<div class="content">
				Protocol for the first 10 days is standard for everyone and is available at www.sehatvan.in in the form
				of a booklet. Subsequent protocols are tailor made to each individual’s needs and situations.


				<br><br>
				Please send an email to <a href="mailto:sehatvan@gmail.com">sehatvan@gmail.com</a> to receive.


			</div>

			<a>PRECAUTION </a>
			<div class="content">
				The protocol should be undertaken under medical supervision as people under medication may require
				dosage adjustments. Also, those carrying toxicities may experience detox symptoms like vomiting,
				diarrhea, skin rashes, body ache, fever etc during autophagy phase. Since Sehatvan is not a medical
				institution, we recommend people coming here keeping in touch with their doctor.
