					<div class="accordion-item">
						<a>What is T2 Diabetes, Thyroidism and Obesity?</a>
						<div class="content">
							<strong>T2 Diabetes, Thyroidism and Obesity</strong> are highly interlinked diseases involving lifestyle
							connected endocrine malfunctioning caused by sedentary living, high mental indulgences, high
							carbohydrate and low fat diet, and epigenetic imbalances. <strong>Thyroidism</strong> has a connection with
							iodine too; earlier most hypothyroidism cases occurred due to iodine deficiency and now most
							are being caused by <strong>iodine excess</strong>.
							<br>
							<img src="../images/dto1.png" alt="" class="rounded wow fadeInRight float-md-right mb-2 mx-1" style="max-width: 100%;">

							<br>
							Lifestyle factors leading to obesity often cause <strong>insulin-resistance</strong>, which leads to over
							production of insulin or hyper-insulinemia, which then further enhances obesity; and hence, a
							person suffering from obesity is often trapped in this cycle of insulin-resistance and
							<strong>hyper-insulinemia</strong>. In most cases this also precipitates in the form of glucose intolerance
							or <strong>T2 Diabetes</strong>. In small number of people lifestyle factors and epigenetic imbalance cause
							T2 Diabetes <strong>without involving obesity</strong>.


						</div>
					</div>

					<a>Past Experience</a>
					<div class="content">
						At Sehatvan we have almost always been <strong>successful</strong> in helping people come out of the DTO trap and
						live a medicine-free healthy life.

					</div>


					<a>Therapeutic Protocol</a>
					<div class="content active">
						Protocol developed at Sehatvan involves a <strong>10-20 days</strong> long forest component and <strong>3-4 weeks </strong>long
						supplementary home component.

					</div>


					<a>Forest Protocol</a>
					<div class="content">
						Forest Protocol is comprised of 3 steps:
						<ol>
							<li>
								1. <strong>Epigenetic balancing (5 days):</strong> Our body’s structure and functionality is encoded in
								our genes or DNA. Over and above this encoding, there exists a switching mechanism which
								controls the expression of each gene. This switching machine is known as <strong>epigenome</strong> and
								is responsive to lifestyle factors and the environment we live in. This mechanism is
								hundreds or thousands or millions of years old and still tuned to the wild setting and
								living that existed for most part of human history excepting the past few decades of
								rapid modernization. Hence, going back to the wild and hunter gatherer kind of living
								quickly reboots the epigenome and fine tunes our genetic expressions. At Sehatvan this
								is achieved by:
								<ul>
									<li>Avoiding all <strong>mental stimulations</strong> and indulgences including Tea/ Coffee,
										Newspapaer, Phone, Books, Music, Non-essential conversations, Yoga & Meditation
									</li>
									<li>
										Soaking in with Sun, Soil and Space in a wild setting and doing a lot of hard
										physical labor
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Autophagic Cleansing and Rejuvenation (5-10 days):</strong> Authophagy is a surprising biological
								tool that can lead to super cleansing of body and mind followed by their rejuvenation.
								Since this involves <strong>detox</strong>, persons may experience vivid symptoms ranging from fever to
								diarrhea or vomiting to skin rashes depending upon the toxicities stored in them, and
								hence, autophagy should <strong>never be attempted in a city</strong> like toxic or non-supportive
								environment. This should be treated as a major intervention in one’s life and taken only
								in a pristine and supportive environment. At Sehatvan we recommend water only fasting
								and mild physical labor during this phase.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Re-strengthening (5 days):</strong> Rushing back to the food and toxic environment immediately
								after the autophagy phase is a horrible idea. It should be stepped-in in a <strong>gradual</strong>
								manner; and hence, one must spend a few more days in a supportive and a pristine
								environment before moving back to the city. This is a called re-strengthening phase, and
								under this people return back to a healthy diet in a gradual manner. Also, physical
								activities are enhanced from mild to moderate to make-up for any muscle loss.


							</li>
						</ol>


					</div>


					<a>Home Protocol</a>
					<div class="content">
						Ultimately people got to live in cities as neither forest can afford internalizing many people,
						nor most people can afford living in a forest; hence, how-so-ever toxic they may be, cities are
						the realities. Following a non-sedentary, low-toxicity lifestyle for next <strong>3-4 weeks</strong> further
						boosts the reversal of DTO.

					</div>

					<a>Daily/ Hourly Protocols </a>
					<div class="content">
						Protocol for the first 10 days is standard for everyone and is available at www.sehatvan.in in
						the form of a booklet. Subsequent protocols are tailor made to each individual’s needs and
						situations.
						<br><br>
						Please send an email to <a href="mailto:sehatvan@gmail.com">sehatvan@gmail.com</a> to receive.

					</div>

					<a>PRECAUTION </a>
					<div class="content">
						The protocol should be undertaken <strong>only under medical supervision</strong> as people under medication
						require continuous dosage adjustments. Also, those carrying toxicities may experience detox
						symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, body ache, fever etc during autophagy phase.
