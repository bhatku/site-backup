				<a>What are Autoimmune Issues </a>
				<div class="content">
					<strong>Immune system</strong> is our body’s defense mechanism and its role is to take care of
					external and internal
					threats; thereby, it is designed and trained to handle invading pathogens at one hand, and hostile
					body cells (like cancer) at the other. Persons with <strong>weak immunity</strong> are prone to
					having infections,
					those with <strong>hyper-immunity</strong> having sensitivities; and therefore, a proper balancing
					and modulation is
					needed. <br> <br>
					Perhaps, this module of forest therapy deals with another dimension of the immune issue – autoimmune
					diseases. <strong>Autoimmune diseases</strong> are the situation when immune system starts attacking
					body’s own
					functional cells thereby either altogether destroying the organ or altering its growth and
					functionality. There are <strong>over 100</strong> autoimmune diseases existing, the most common
					among them are: Type
					1 Diabetes, Lupus, Rheumatoid arthritis, Multiple sclerosis, Psoriasis, Eczema, Vitiligo,
					Thyroidism, Ulcerative colitis, Alopecia areata etc. Allergy and Asthmas also have autoimmune
					connection. In a nutshell autoimmune diseases are <strong>like your own security guard attacking
						you.</strong>





					<br>
					<img src="../images/ai1.png" alt="" class="rounded wow fadeInRight float-md-right mb-2 mx-1"
						style="max-width: 100%;">


					Considering the basics of the immunity first: immune system functions through mainly two tools –
					<strong>immune cells</strong>, such as T cells and natural killer cells, and a range of
					<strong>antigen specific antibodies</strong>.
					The task of immune system could primarily be divided in two parts – 1) surveillance, and 2)
					regulation. <strong>Surveillance</strong> is quite a challenging task whereby T cells check each and
					every cell (also
					cell components and products) in the body for its nationality and loyalty/goodness, anything foreign
					or having turned unfaithful is alerted for and handled accordingly. Autoimmune diseases mainly occur
					due to some problem in this surveillance – either the surveying cells having become
					<strong>mis-educated </strong>or
					the surveyed ones having altered in some way to look suspicious or harmful. Current approach to
					handle the situation is by <strong>administering immunosuppressive agents</strong> so that the whole
					immune system is
					kind of blinded or cornered. However, this cannot be the solutions, and it is for this reason why
					all autoimmune diseases are <strong>medically incurable</strong>.

					<br>
					<img src="../images/ai2.png" alt="" class="rounded wow fadeInRight float-md-right mb-2 mx-1"
						style="max-width: 100%;">


					<br>

					In this module we attempt to 1) <strong>reverse the alterations</strong> in host cells and, 2)
					reeducate, <strong>reboot</strong> or modulate the immune system. The alteration in the host is usually caused by
					bound medicines,
					chemicals, undesired metabolites or toxins and autophagic detox is a great way to getting rid of
					most
					of these alterations, and thereby, returning back to the pristine self. Autophagy also reboots and
					reeducates the immune system. Prior to autophagy a five days <strong>epigenetic balancing</strong> protocol helps in
					regulating the gene switching. Self-hatred and depression are also known to have linkage with
					autoimmunity, because when this - destroying to one self – keeps going in the mind for too long, the
					immunity starts obeying the signal.
					<br><br>
					There is one more dimension to this, and that perhaps could be the <strong>most important cause</strong> of
					autoimmune issues – we are a bit too sanitized and our immune system doesn’t have enough engagement
					outside; hence, it turns more to inside, like army of a country having no external threat. Enhancing
					the external threat a little bit by enriching the microbiota, by cutting down on sanitization, and
					once in a while having minor injuries, bruises is likely to make the whole immune system more
					extrovert, and thereby, reduce its hyper inside focus. Tense borders boost national loyalty. Also,
					<strong>our microbiota is like our closest or internal forests</strong> and a rich forest has a balanced ecosystem.

					<br>

				</div>
			</div>
			<a>Therapeutic Protocol</a>
			<div class="content active">
				The protocol has 3 in-forest and 1 post-forest stages. It begins with acclimatization and epigenetic
				balancing and then moves to autophagic cleansing and immunity rebooting, followed by microbiota
				enhancing steps.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Acclimatization and Epigenetic Balancing (5 days):</strong> <br> Forest stay helps
						fine-tunes gene switching, and once gene-switching is fine-tuned most cell functions and
						antibody production become remarkably error-free. During this stage we also like people
						enhancing their connection with the nature; sanitization dramatically reduces our nature
						connection and most of us are actually over-sanitized. In this phase its recommended getting
						loose on hygiene – getting dirty, avoiding bathing, putting on unwashed clothes, and above all –
						not using any cleansing agent like soap, shampoo, hand wash etc. Lot of hard physical labor and
						sun exposure help reduce, self-hatred, if any. Cow-dung and mud are great antidepressant as well
						as probiotic.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Autophagic cleansing and rejuvenation (5-10 days):</strong> <br> Water only fast for 5
						or more days dramatically cleanses body by detoxing. In this phase virtually all the build-up of
						the bound medicines, bound chemicals, undesired metabolites and toxins is cleared away, thereby
						body becoming pure and clean, and hence, autoimmunity is reduced. Longer fasts are rejuvenative
						in nature and lead to rebooting the immunity and formation of new stem cells. This way the
						immune system also gets optimized from within. However, in autophagy mode people carrying large
						toxicities may feel varied uncomfortable detox symptoms, and hence, this step should be taken-up
						under a supportive and pristine environment only. Medical supervision is compulsory for people
						on medication.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Microbiota Building (5 days): </strong> <br>
						Strong microbiota is the strongest and the most lasting protection against all diseases in
						general and autoimmune diseases in particular. After gradual eating restoration body is actively
						exposed so as to enrich its microbiota on the skin as well as inside the intestine. This is
						achieved by using fermented food, drinking raw water and keeping sanitation to bare minimum.
					</li>
					<img src="../images/ai4.png" alt="" class="rounded wow fadeInRight float-md-right mb-2 mx-1"
						style="max-width: 100%;">

				</ol>

			</div>



			<a>Supplementary Home Protocol</a>
			<div class="content">
				Subsequent to the forest components participants are given a tailor made home protocol, which primarily
				aims at living a non-sedentary, low-sanitization, low-toxicity lifestyle with probiotic nutrition for 3
				to 4 weeks. All kinds of packaged food and drinks must be avoided during this phase as package food
				contains preservatives that destroy the intestinal microbiota.




			</div>
			<a>Daily/ Hourly Protocols </a>
			<div class="content">
				Protocol for the first 10 days is standard for everyone and is available at www.sehatvan.in in the form
				of a booklet. Subsequent protocols are tailor made to each individual’s needs and situations.




			</div>

			<a>PRECAUTION </a>
			<div class="content">
				The protocol should be undertaken under medical supervision as people under medication may require
				dosage adjustments. Also, those carrying toxicities may experience detox symptoms like vomiting,
				diarrhea, skin rashes, body ache, fever etc during autophagy phase. Since Sehatvan is not a medical
				institution, we recommend people coming here keeping in touch with their doctor. The effectiveness of
				this protocol is not established in all autoimmune issue. Medical supervision is extremely must for
				people suffering from T1 Diabetes and on insulin.


			</div>


			<a>PRECAUTION </a>
			<div class="content">
				This protocol hasn’t been tested for all autoimmune situations and might remain ineffective in some.
				Also, protocol’s multiple administration may require with some people.
